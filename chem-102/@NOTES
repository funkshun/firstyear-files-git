KINETIC MOLECULAR GAS THEORY

Solids and liquids are condensed phases
Phase depends on KE of particles and attraction strength between particles
Temp is the average kinetic energy of a system

Tenets
Gases are composed of molecules in constant motion travelling in straight lines
and only changing directions with collisions

The molecules are very small

The pressure is the force exerted by collisions between the molecules and the
container

All energy is held as kinetic energy

Average energy is proportional to the absolute temperature

INTERMOLECULAR FORCES
-Distance must be extremely small

TYPES OF FORCES

{Coulombs Law
Eel = (Q1Q2)/d}

--London Dispersion Forces--
-Dispersion forces arise during instantaneous electron states where the
distribution of electrons is not even. This generates a temporary dipole which
can then induce a dipole in neareby atoms. 
-Larger molecules have larger dispersion forces due to larger electron clouds.
-Most common in Halogens
-Shape matters: large surface area (linear molecules) will have a larger
dispersion area compared to smaller surface area (spherical molecules)

--Dipole-Dipole Interactions--
-Polar molecules are described as having a dipole moment
-Polarity arises due to the existence of polar bonds in a non-symetrical way
{Dipole Moment
mu = delta(r)}
NOTE: Boron execptions

--HYDROGEN BONDS--
-Hydrogen bonded to O, N , or F
-Hydrogen bonding
