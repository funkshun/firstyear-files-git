Thinking About Change{
    Resilience = ability of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while     undergoing change
    Change is constant and non-linear
    Extreme Events (Stochastic events, chaos and complexity theory)
    Recognize the importance of 'life support' systems (atmosphere, climate,
    etc.)

    Concepts of Resilience Thinking{
        Critical Thresholds of Change:
            Importance of slow moving variables
        Response Diversity:
            Different organisms with different responses to disturbance
        Complex Systems:
            Exhibit emergent and self organizing properties
        Regime Change:
            Movement from one stable state from another
            As resilience declines, small disturbances can nudge system over
            threshold
            Key variable often slow-moving e.g. population change
